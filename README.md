# Algorithms  
Some Algorithm Implementations in Python 

# The algorithms are : Binary Search , Divide & Conquer and Selection Sort

   - # Binary Search :
        Binary search, also known as half-interval search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
   
   - # Divide & Conquer :
        - Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm. A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
        - D&C isn’t a simple algorithm that you can apply to a problem. Instead, it’s a way to think about a problem.
